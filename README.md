Checkers Game!

This is a web based Checkers game made by me, TheBooker66, using javacript and HTML.
The stable branch of the game features local player vs player and player vs an AI.
The experimental branch of the game features the stable branch plus a smarter AI for the computer.

The Stable version of the game can be played here: https://checkers-12.web.app/
